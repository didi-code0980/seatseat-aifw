description: Commit and push a ticket's finished lane work, then release the branch for the next lane
argument-hint: <TICKET-ID>
---

Run in **the session of the role that produced the lane's last gate** — not a separate orchestrator
session. Changed 2026-08-25 on the operator's instruction. Nothing is dispatched.

| Folder | Who runs `/handoff` | Because it just closed |
|---|---|---|
| `aiw-design` | `tech-lead-design` | the `design` gate |
| `aiw-implement` | `qa` | the `qa` gate |

**The lane that finished the work now persists it.** The previous arrangement routed both hand-offs
through `orchestrator`, on the stated grounds that it was the only role permitted to commit and that
the constructing roles held no `Bash` tool. The first half was a rule and has been amended; **the
second half was simply false** — every agent definition under `.claude/agents/` grants `Bash`, `ba`
included. Three documents asserted a capability limit that the frontmatter never imposed. MD-27.

The consequence worth noticing: **the implement lane no longer needs an `orchestrator` session at
all.** `/implement`, `/review`, `/qa` and `/handoff` each have an owner there, and `orchestrator`
remains only in `aiw-design`, for `/next-ticket` and `/ship`.

A session's folder is still fixed at launch, so the role running this command is the one whose
working tree holds the files being committed. That has not changed and is not negotiable by argument.

**This command exists because a lane cannot hand a ticket on by itself.** Every stage leaves its
worktree dirty, and git refuses one branch in two worktrees. Without a step that persists the work and
*releases the branch name*, the next lane's `git switch` fails with:

```
fatal: 'feat/<TICKET-ID>' is already checked out at '/Users/mpa/Desktop/<folder>'
```

MD-15. Two hand-offs use this command — design→build, and build→ship — and the shape is the same
both times.

## 0. Confirm the branch and the folder, before anything

**Mode: stop** — the table in `.ai/standards/git-conventions.md`, *The branch check every ticket
command runs*. This command never creates a branch; it is the one that hands an existing one on.

```
pwd
git branch --show-current
git fetch origin --quiet
git status --porcelain
```

You must already be on `feat/$ARGUMENTS`. **If you are not, stop** — a hand-off is a claim about the
work in *this* worktree, and switching to the branch first would leave the dirty files behind and push
an empty lane. If the branch does not exist, stop and report; there is nothing to hand off.

A hand-off run from the wrong folder pushes the wrong lane's work, and since ADR-004 nothing stops it
(`.ai/standards/session-model.md`, *What no longer protects this*).

## 1. Decide which hand-off this is, from `ticket.yaml`

Read the `gates` map. Do not infer it from which files exist.

| Gates passed | You are | Hand-off | Next lane |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spec` and `design` | `tech-lead-design` | **design → implement** | `aiw-implement` — `/implement` |
| `review` and `qa` | `qa` | **implement → ship** | `aiw-design` — `/ship` |

**If the gates say one thing and your own role says the other, stop.** A `qa` session reading a tree
whose `design` gate has just passed is in the wrong folder — the two hand-offs are not
interchangeable and neither is the working tree each one commits.

Anything else is not a hand-off. If `design` passed and `review` did not while you are in the build
lane, the ticket is mid-lane: stop and say which stage is unfinished. This command never persists a
lane that has not completed — a pushed branch is a claim that a lane is done.

## 2. Classify the working tree

`git status --porcelain`, and sort every dirty path into two sets against `allowed_paths` in
`ticket.yaml`:

- **Ticket set** — matches `allowed_paths`, or sits under `.ai/board/tickets/$ARGUMENTS/`.
- **Everything else** — model, registry, standards, hooks, scripts, tooling, stray files.

A path you cannot classify goes in the second set; you do not guess it into the ticket. **Do not print
the two sets** — the commit you are about to make is the record, and `git show --stat` reads it back.
Print only the paths that made you stop.

**`.ai/board/metrics.md` and `.ai/board/backlog.md` are never in the ticket set, and never yours
here.** They belong to `/ship` alone — see *The one surface that still collides* in
`.ai/standards/session-model.md`. If a stage has left them dirty, that is the second set.

## 3. Commit the ticket set on `feat/$ARGUMENTS`

Confirm the branch first; if it is anything else, stop. `git add` with explicit paths — never `-A`,
never `.`. How many commits and what each message says is yours to decide: group by coherence, one
assertion per commit, message form per `.ai/standards/git-conventions.md`.

Then `git push -u origin feat/$ARGUMENTS`, which prompts.

## 4. `node scripts/check-allowed-paths.mjs`

It diffs `origin/main...HEAD` — the **whole branch**, not your last commit. A FAIL means the branch
carries a file outside `allowed_paths`, and the fix is to move that file to the second set, never to
widen the list.

At the design hand-off the branch holds only `.ai/board/tickets/$ARGUMENTS/**`, which is a subset of
`allowed_paths` and passes. That is not a weaker check — it is the check confirming DESIGN wrote
nothing it had not declared.

## 5. If the second set is non-empty, it gets its own branch

`git switch -c ops/<slug> main`, commit it there in whatever grouping you judge coherent, push. Name
the slug for the work, not for the ticket. Do **not** fold it into the ticket branch — step 4 will
fail if you do, and branch protection then blocks the merge a human is waiting to make.

**No pull request here.** A hand-off is not a ship. The `ops/` branch is pushed and left for `/ship`
or for the operator to open; opening a PR mid-loop asks a human to review work whose ticket has not
finished.

If that set touches a CODEOWNERS path — `.ai/registry/`, `.ai/standards/`, `prisma/`, `.claude/`,
`.github/`, `.mcp.json` — say so explicitly, file by file, in the output. You are recording a human's
change so it can be reviewed, not authoring one.

**This step is the widest thing either hand-off role does, and for `qa` it is wider than the rest of
that role.** RULE-13 discards `qa` after every verdict and `guard-read-scope.mjs` refuses it `src/**`,
yet here it commits registry and standards files. Recording is not authoring and the `ops/` branch
still faces CODEOWNERS review, so nothing is decided by the commit — but if this set is ever large or
surprising, say so and stop rather than grouping it into something coherent-looking. MD-28.

## 6. Park the lane on the latest `main`. This step is the whole point

Once the branch is pushed, put the worktree back on current `main` and give the name up:

```
git fetch origin --quiet
git switch --detach origin/main
git fetch origin main:main --quiet
```

**Line 2 is detached-at-`origin/main`, not `git switch main`, and the difference is not stylistic.**
Git holds every branch name exclusively across worktrees and `main` is not special. Verified by
attempt, 2026-08-24, with two throwaway worktrees:

```
$ git -C wt2 switch main
fatal: 'main' is already checked out at '.../wt1'
```

Both lanes run `/handoff`. If both parked on the branch `main`, whichever ran second would fail
outright. Detaching at `origin/main` gives the same working tree — the latest `main`, ready for
whatever comes next — and collides with nothing.

**Line 3 fast-forwards the local `main` ref without checking it out**, so `main` stops drifting behind
the remote. It is a courtesy rather than a requirement: every branch in this model is cut from
`origin/main`, so nothing reads local `main`. If it fails — not fast-forwardable, or some worktree does
hold `main` — say so in one line and carry on. It is not a reason to stop a completed hand-off.

**Verify the release, do not assume it.** `git branch --show-current` must print nothing. A hand-off
that reports success while still holding `feat/$ARGUMENTS` is the one failure this command exists to
prevent, and it fails in the *other* folder, minutes later, where it is hardest to read.

## 7. Sign off, and let the sign-off be the reply

The next command and its folder go in the *Tiếp theo* line of the block in `CLAUDE.md`. There is no
separate report — if the hand-off did what it says, **four lines is the whole reply**. Do not narrate
steps 0 to 6, do not tabulate what passed, do not restate what this file already says.

Prose above the block is for a stop, a finding, or something you did differently. A hand-off that
found the lane already handed off, or a `state:` that disagrees with what is on the branch, is exactly
that kind of finding: one or two sentences, then the block.

When the next move in this folder is `/spec`, the command alone is enough — `ba` holds `Bash` and
`/spec` step 0 cuts `feat/<ID>` from `origin/main` itself (MD-18), which is the state step 6 left this
folder in.

## What this command never does

- **No `gh pr create`.** That is `/ship` step 7.
- **No `state:` transition.** The stage owner sets it; you persist it.
- **No write to `metrics.md` or `backlog.md`.** `/ship` owns both.
- **No merge, and `main` is never a commit or push target.** RULE-09.
