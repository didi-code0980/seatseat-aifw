description: Run the IN_PROGRESS stage — the Developer implements the design
argument-hint: <TICKET-ID>
---

Run in the **Developer session in the `aiw-implement` folder — the implement lane** — on branch `feat/$ARGUMENTS`.

## Step 0 — confirm the branch before writing anything

**Mode: stop.** Run the four reads and follow the table in `.ai/standards/git-conventions.md`,
*The branch check every ticket command runs*. This command may **not** create `feat/$ARGUMENTS`.

```
pwd
git branch --show-current
git fetch origin --quiet
git status --porcelain
```

- Already on `feat/$ARGUMENTS` — proceed.
- Elsewhere or detached, tree clean, the branch exists on `refs/heads` or `refs/remotes/origin` —
  `git switch feat/$ARGUMENTS` (add `-c feat/$ARGUMENTS origin/feat/$ARGUMENTS` when it is
  remote-only), then `git pull --ff-only`.
- Tree dirty — **stop.** Print the paths and say which ticket they belong to.
- **The branch does not exist — stop and report to the operator.** Do not create it. Only `/spec`
  creates a `feat/` branch. Arriving here with no branch means SPEC never ran, a `/handoff` never
  pushed, or the ID is wrong, and the three need different answers. Say which you cannot rule out.

The story and the design arrive **already committed**, pushed by `/handoff` from the design lane. Two
failures here look similar and are not: `fatal: ... already checked out at ...` means the design lane
still holds the branch and has not handed off, while a branch that does not exist at all means SPEC or
DESIGN never ran. Neither is fixed by starting from `main` — `02-design.md` would be missing and
`allowed_paths` with it, and RULE-03 would then have nothing to enforce.

 That session is ephemeral but
**survives REWORK** — keep it open until the ticket is DONE or ESCALATED, and re-run this command in
the same session on a rework cycle. Restarting it every cycle would spend the RULE-06 budget
re-deriving the design instead of fixing what the reviewer found
(`.ai/standards/session-model.md`).

**Artifacts in:** `ticket.yaml`, `01-story.md`, `02-design.md`, `.ai/standards/**`
**Artifacts out:** code inside `allowed_paths`, and
`.ai/board/tickets/$ARGUMENTS/03-impl-log.md`
**Template:** `.ai/templates/impl-log.md`

**Gate:** `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` exit 0; every contract item in design section 1 is
implemented; `03-impl-log.md` lists every file touched with a one-line reason.

Check the branch first. `guard-allowed-paths.mjs` resolves the ticket from `feat/<ID>`, so work done
on another branch name runs with the path guard inactive.

The Developer may consult `tech-lead-design` and `ba` by writing
`.ai/board/tickets/$ARGUMENTS/99-questions.md` with `to:` naming the agent. It may not address
`tech-lead-review` or `qa` before their verdicts exist — `chat-guard.mjs` blocks that write
(RULE-12).

On PASS, set the ticket to `REVIEW` and **print the next command and its session** — do not invoke
it:

```
IN_PROGRESS passed. Run /review ROO-01 in a FRESH session, discarded after the verdict.
```

The reviewer's session must be new. It never inherits this one: a reviewer holding the developer's
framing has lost the independence that makes the review worth running, before the first check is
evaluated (RULE-13).

## Last step: sign off

**End your reply with the block in `## Replying` (`CLAUDE.md`).** It is not a footer on the reply —
for most runs it *is* the reply. Do not stop at the step above and leave the operator to work out who
answered, whether it passed, where the repository is, and what runs next.

The *first* line quotes the `gate` from the front-matter you just wrote. *Tiếp theo* names the next
stage command **and its folder** — `aiw-design`, `aiw-implement` or `aiw-steward`.
Read the two values rather than recalling them:

```
date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z'
git branch --show-current
```

A remembered timestamp or branch is the one part of this block that can be wrong while looking right.
