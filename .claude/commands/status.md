description: Read the board and report what is true, what is waiting on you, and what runs next
---

Run in the **steward session**. **Read only. This command writes nothing** — not `ticket.yaml`, not
`backlog.md`, not the session log.

## What this reads, and why it is not a session monitor

**Each Claude Code session is a separate process. This command cannot see what another session is
doing, and should not.**

That is not a limitation to work around. RULE-13 requires the reviewer to be blind to everything but
files, and a status command that could see into a live `tech-lead-review` session would be a channel
into the one role the model deliberately isolates. The same property that makes cross-session
visibility impossible is the property that makes the review worth running.

What it reads instead is the repository, which is the source of truth anyway. **A session is where
someone is typing; `ticket.yaml` is what is true.** A stage half-finished in an open tab has not
happened. If that feels like missing information, the missing information is the point: an artifact
on disk with a gate in its front-matter is a claim someone committed to, and an in-progress buffer is
not.

**Inputs:**

- every `.ai/board/tickets/*/ticket.yaml`
- `.ai/board/backlog.md`
- `.ai/board/model-debt.md`
- `.ai/steward/context.md`
- the tail of `.ai/board/metrics.md`
- `git log -10`, `git status`
- the front-matter `gate` field of each artifact in the active ticket's folder

## Output — this order, and nothing else

### 1. One line: what is happening right now

`ROO-01 at DESIGN, blocked on the seam contract in section 1.`

If nothing is in flight, say so in one line. Do not pad it.

### 2. Board

| Ticket | State | Owner | Gates passed | Rework | Blocked on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Owner comes from the stage ownership table in `.ai/01-operating-model.md`, keyed on state. Gates
passed comes from the `gates` map in `ticket.yaml` — **the `passed: true` entries with timestamps**,
not from the presence of an artifact file.

### 3. Waiting on you

**The important section.** Everything here names an exact action, not a topic.

- anything `ESCALATED`
- any unanswered question in a `99-questions.md` — a block with a `Q.` and no `A.`
- any 🟡 in a story
- any registry paste outstanding, per the session log in `.ai/steward/context.md`

**Empty is a valid and good answer.** Do not manufacture entries to make the section look
substantial. "Nothing is waiting on you" is a real result and the one the loop is supposed to produce.

### 4. Next command

Which slash command, in which session, derived from the state and the lifecycle table in
`.ai/01-operating-model.md`:

```
ROO-01 is READY. Run /design ROO-01 in the Tech Lead session.
```

**If the next move is a human decision, say that instead** — do not name a command that cannot
usefully run. A ticket at `ESCALATED` has no command; it has a decision.

### 5. Model debt

One line. Open count by severity from `.ai/board/model-debt.md`.

### 6. Since last time

What changed since the last session-log entry in `.ai/steward/context.md`. If the log is empty, say
that this is the first session rather than reporting the whole repository as new.

## Rules for this command

- **Report only what the files say.** Every claim traces to a line you read.
- **If `backlog.md` and a `ticket.yaml` disagree, show both and name `ticket.yaml` as
  authoritative — do not silently reconcile.** Repairing the view is the orchestrator's job, and a
  status command that quietly fixed the disagreement would destroy the evidence that they had drifted.
  The drift is a finding.
- **Never claim a stage ran without a gate timestamp to cite.** An artifact file existing is not a
  gate passing; a `04-review.md` with `gate: FAIL` is a stage that ran and refused.
- Writes nothing, changes no state, and advances no ticket.
