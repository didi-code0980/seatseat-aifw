description: Build, mark the ticket DONE, and open a pull request
argument-hint: <TICKET-ID>
---

Run in the **orchestrator session in the `aiw-design` folder — the design lane**
(`.ai/standards/session-model.md`). Nothing is dispatched. Moved out of the implement lane 2026-08-24:
shipping reads gates, opens a pull request and waits on a human, and none of that needs the folder
that writes `src/**`.

**Preconditions — all four gates `passed: true` with timestamps.** Verify against `ticket.yaml`, not
against a summary.

Steps:

0. **Confirm the branch. Mode: stop** — the table in `.ai/standards/git-conventions.md`, *The branch
   check every ticket command runs*. `pwd`, `git branch --show-current`, `git fetch origin --quiet`,
   `git status --porcelain`, then `git switch feat/$ARGUMENTS && git pull --ff-only`.

   If the switch fails with `fatal: 'feat/$ARGUMENTS' is already checked out at ...`, the implement lane
   has not run `/handoff` and this ticket is not ready to ship. Print the folder git named and stop —
   do not work around it, and never `git worktree` your way past it. **If the branch does not exist
   at all, stop and report**; this command never creates one.

   The implementation, the tests and artifacts 03–06 arrive already committed, by `/handoff`. Do not
   expect a dirty tree full of `src/**`; if you find one, the implement lane's hand-off did not complete
   and the QA gate you are trusting was never persisted.

1. `pnpm verify` — typecheck, lint, unit, build. Any non-zero exit stops here.
2. Confirm the full Definition of Done in `.ai/01-operating-model.md`, item by item.
3. Set `state: DONE`, move the row to `## ARCHIVE` in `backlog.md`, append to `metrics.md`.
4. **Classify the working tree.** `git status --porcelain`, and sort every dirty path into two sets
   against `allowed_paths` in `ticket.yaml`:

   - **Ticket set** — matches `allowed_paths`, or sits under `.ai/board/tickets/$ARGUMENTS/`. After
     step 0 this is normally only what step 3 just wrote: `ticket.yaml`, `backlog.md`, `metrics.md`.
   - **Everything else** — model, registry, standards, hooks, scripts, tooling, stray files.

   Print both sets before touching git. A path you cannot classify goes in the second set; you do
   not guess it into the ticket.

   **`metrics.md` and `backlog.md` are yours and only yours.** No other command writes them — see
   *The one surface that still collides* in `.ai/standards/session-model.md`. They sit outside every
   `allowed_paths`, and they belong in the ticket set anyway, because a board that records a ship in a
   separate pull request from the ship is a board that can be merged out of order.

5. **Commit the ticket set on `feat/$ARGUMENTS`.** Confirm the branch first; if it is anything else,
   stop. `git add` with explicit paths — never `-A`, never `.`. This is the ship commit — the state
   transition and the board, on top of the two `/handoff` commits already on the branch. Message form
   per `.ai/standards/git-conventions.md`. Then `git push origin feat/$ARGUMENTS`, which prompts.

6. `node scripts/check-allowed-paths.mjs`. It diffs `origin/main...HEAD` — the **whole branch**, not
   your last commit. A FAIL here means the ticket branch carries a file outside `allowed_paths`, and
   the fix is to move that file to the second set, never to widen the list.

7. **Open the pull request against `main`**, body linking `.ai/board/tickets/$ARGUMENTS/` and listing
   the four gate timestamps.

   `gh pr create` when `gh auth status` reports a logged-in host. **When it does not, the fallback is
   not an improvisation — it is this, and it counts as step 7 completed:** print a
   `github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/main...feat/$ARGUMENTS?expand=1&title=…&body=…` URL with the
   title and body already percent-encoded into it, so the operator lands on a filled form and presses
   one button.

   **Check `gh auth status` before composing either, and never run `gh auth login`.** It is an
   interactive TUI: it waits on stdin for an account, a protocol, and a pasted device code, and from a
   non-interactive session it hangs until it is killed. Authenticating is the operator's to do, once,
   outside the loop.

   This step has failed on both of the two ships that have reached it — `gh` absent at ROO-01, `gh`
   unauthenticated at DEV-01 — and each time the outcome was a ticket that was DONE with an empty PR
   column and a human left to guess the next move. MD-17. A branch name is not a request; it is
   homework.

8. **If the second set is non-empty, it gets its own branch and its own pull request.** `git switch
   -c ops/<slug> main`, commit it there in whatever grouping you judge coherent, push, `gh pr
   create`. Name the slug for the work, not for the ticket. Do **not** leave it dirty and do not
   fold it into the ticket branch — step 6 will fail if you do, and branch protection will then
   block the merge a human is waiting to make.

   If that set touches a CODEOWNERS path — `.ai/registry/`, `.ai/standards/`, `prisma/`, `.claude/`,
   `.github/`, `.mcp.json` — say so explicitly in the PR body, file by file. You are recording a
   human's change so it can be reviewed, not authoring one: RULE-01 still governs who writes the
   registry, and `guard-registry.mjs` still refuses you.

9. If `tracker.sync_enabled` is true, push `gate_state` and `pr_url`. If it is false, skip silently —
   that is the expected state for early tickets.

10. **Print the next action and its session** — do not invoke it:

```
MEM-01 is DONE, PR #12 opened. Merging is yours.
Once it is merged, run /implement SEA-01 in the aiw-implement folder — SEA-01's design handoff is already
pushed and its branch is free.
```

Name the folder, not just the command. Three worktrees mean a correct command in the wrong folder
writes to the wrong branch, and since ADR-004 nothing refuses it.

11. **Park the lane on the latest `main`** — same three commands as `/handoff` step 6, same reasons:

    ```
    git fetch origin --quiet
    git switch --detach origin/main
    git fetch origin main:main --quiet
    ```

    The pull request is open and the branch belongs to whoever merges it. This folder's next job is
    `/spec` on a different ticket, and it cannot cut one while holding this.

**The output is an open pull request. Never a merge.** RULE-09 makes merging permanently human, and
`gh pr merge` is denied in settings.

You commit here and in `/handoff`, and nowhere else. Every stage leaves its tree dirty; those two
commands are the only ones that persist it. Two things are never yours: `main` as a target, and the
merge.

**Definition of Done item 2 — "diff is a subset of `allowed_paths`" — is a statement about the
ticket branch**, which is why step 8 exists. It was written when nothing was ever committed, so it
never had to say which branch it meant. It means `feat/$ARGUMENTS`.
