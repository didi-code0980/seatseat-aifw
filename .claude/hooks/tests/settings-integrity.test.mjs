// This environment has been observed appending session permission grants to `.claude/settings.json`
// rather than to `.claude/settings.local.json`, silently overwriting the governance config. When that
// happens the deny list and all five hooks vanish, and nothing about the session looks different: the
// guards simply stop guarding, which is the exact failure mode the whole Phase A layer exists to
// prevent.
//
// Two detectors now. The first is `git diff .claude/settings.json`, available because Phase A is
// committed. It is only useful if a human looks. This is the second, and it runs in CI on every push
// and pull request via `node --test .claude/hooks/tests/`, where nobody has to remember to look.
//
// Every assertion below names the exact missing key, because "settings.json changed" is not
// actionable and "the deny rule mcp__clickup__clickup_search is missing" is.

// matcher -> the hook scripts that must be wired to it, in order.

// chat-guard.mjs appears twice on purpose. It guards two transports: the tool transport
// (Agent | Task | SendMessage) and the file transport (a write to 99-questions.md), and the file
// transport only fires if the hook is wired to Edit|Write as well. Wiring it to one and not the
// other leaves half of RULE-12 as prose — which is exactly how it was wrong before, when the hook
// had no matcher at all.
//
// Order within Edit|Write matters: the path guards run first, so a question file written outside the
