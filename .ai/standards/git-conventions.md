# Git conventions

## Line endings

`.gitattributes` sets `* text=auto eol=lf`, with explicit `eol=lf` for `.mjs`, `.md`, `.json`,
`.yaml`, and `.yml`. It was the first file created in this repository, before any other content, so
that nothing was ever committed with the wrong endings.

The system `core.autocrlf=true` on this machine does not override it — `.gitattributes` wins per
path. Do not configure an editor or a hook to change this.

This matters more than it looks. CRLF in a `.mjs` file that another tool executes, or in a fixture a
test compares against, produces failures that reproduce on one machine and not another.

## Branches

One branch per ticket. **The name is not decoration** —
`.claude/hooks/guard-allowed-paths.mjs` and `scripts/check-allowed-paths.mjs` both resolve the
active ticket by parsing it, and both treat anything that does not begin `feat/` as chore work and let
it through unchecked.

### The four names

| Kind | Pattern | Example | Cut from | Path guard |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feature ticket | `feat/<FEATURE-ID>` | `feat/SYS-01` | `origin/main` | **active** |
| Bugfix on a shipped feature | `bugfix/BUG_<FEATURE-ID>_<NN>` | `bugfix/BUG_SYS-01_01` | `origin/main` | inactive — MD-20 |
| Chore, model, tooling | `ops/<slug>` | `ops/lane-handoff` | `origin/main` | inactive, correctly |
| — | ~~`fix/`~~ | — | — | **retired** |

`<FEATURE-ID>` is a row in `.ai/registry/features.md` and nothing else — RULE-17, and check D1 fails
the audit on an ID that does not resolve. `<NN>` is two digits, sequential per feature, starting `01`.
The bug ID carries its parent feature inside it on purpose: a bug branch that cannot be traced to a
feature is a bug nobody can decide the priority of.

**`fix/` is retired**, replaced by `bugfix/` with a structured ID. It was named in this document from
the beginning and never used; it had no ID scheme, so two defects on the same feature produced two
branch names with nothing in common.

**`bugfix/` runs with the path guard disabled, and that is a defect rather than a decision.** Both
resolvers hard-code the string `feat/`. A bugfix branch therefore gets no `allowed_paths` enforcement
at write time and no CI check on the diff — for work that touches shipped code, which is when it
matters most. MD-20 carries it, and the fix is a change to two files, not a change to this convention.

### The branch check every ticket command runs

Every command that takes a `<TICKET-ID>` opens with the same four reads, before it writes anything:

```
pwd
git branch --show-current
git fetch origin --quiet
git status --porcelain
```

Then one of two modes. **Which mode a command is in is stated in that command's step 0 and is not the
running agent's to choose.**

| Mode | Commands | When the branch does not exist |
|---|---|---|
| **create** | `/spec` only | `git switch -c feat/<ID> origin/main` |
| **stop** | every other ticket command | **Stop and report to the operator.** Do not create it. |

**Only `/spec` may bring a `feat/` branch into existence.** Every later stage arriving at a missing
branch means something upstream did not happen — SPEC was never run, or a `/handoff` never pushed, or
the ID is wrong. Creating it there would manufacture an empty branch that looks like progress and
hides which of the three it was.

Common to both modes, in every command:

- **A dirty tree is a stop.** `git switch` carries modified and untracked files onto the branch you
  arrive at, which is how one ticket's artifacts land on another ticket's branch. Print the paths and
  say which ticket they belong to.
- **`fatal: '<branch>' is already checked out at '<folder>'` is a stop**, not a problem to route
  around. Another worktree holds it. Print the folder git named. Never `git worktree` past it and
  never `git -C` into it.
- **Existence is two refs, not one.** Check `refs/heads/<branch>` and `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`
  separately — a branch released by `/handoff` exists on the remote while the worktree that produced
  it does not hold it.
- **Cut from `origin/main`, never local `main`.** No lane checks `main` out, so nothing updates it;
  a branch cut from local `main` looks correct and silently omits everything merged since.

## Commits

**Agents do not commit — with one exception: the `orchestrator`, inside `/handoff` and `/ship`.**
Every other stage leaves the working tree dirty. That is deliberate: a commit is an assertion that a
change is coherent, and that assertion is one of the things being validated.

The exception was `/ship` alone until 2026-08-24, and it existed because `/ship` could not complete
itself: its step 4 requires an open pull request, a pull request requires commits on a pushed branch,
and this section forbade the only agent in that command from producing them while no step asked a
human to. MD-07.

**`/handoff` was added for the same reason one lane further up.** Under the three-worktree arrangement
a ticket crosses folders twice, and the artifacts one lane produced are the input the next lane reads.
An input that exists only as a dirty file in a folder the next lane cannot open is not an input, and
the constructing roles that produce it — `ba`, `tech-lead-design` — hold no `Bash` tool and cannot
persist it themselves. MD-15. Three commit points now, one per boundary:

| Command | Lane | Commits |
|---|---|---|
| `/handoff` | `aiw-work`, after DESIGN | the story and the design |
| `/handoff` | `aiw`, after QA | `src/**`, `tests/**`, artifacts 03–06 |
| `/ship` | `aiw-work` | `state: DONE`, the board files, then the pull request |

Every `/handoff` ends by releasing the branch name (`git switch --detach`), because git holds a branch
exclusively across worktrees and the next lane's `git switch` fails outright without it. Details in
`.ai/standards/session-model.md` and `.claude/commands/handoff.md`.

**RULE-09 is unchanged and needed no ADR.** It names schema changes, ADRs, registry edits and PR
merges. Committing was never among them — the prohibition lived here, in a standard, and it is this
standard that was amended.

### What the orchestrator decides

How the work is grouped. It classifies the working tree, chooses which files form one coherent
change, how many commits there are, and what each message says. That judgement is its own and this
document does not constrain it.

### What it does not decide

**The branch boundary, because CI is branch-scoped and not commit-scoped.**
`scripts/check-allowed-paths.mjs` computes its diff as `origin/main...HEAD` — the whole branch.
Splitting mixed work into separate *commits* on `feat/<TICKET-ID>` therefore buys nothing: the
`allowed-paths` check still sees every file on the branch, fails, and branch protection then blocks
the very merge a human is meant to perform. The split has to be by branch.

| Set | Contents | Branch | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ticket | paths matching `allowed_paths`, plus `.ai/board/tickets/<TICKET-ID>/**` | `feat/<TICKET-ID>` | the ticket's pull request |
| Everything else | model, registry, standards, hooks, scripts, tooling | `ops/<slug>` cut from `main` | a second pull request, reviewed on its own |

The `ops/` branch is not a lesser pull request, and committing a CODEOWNERS path is not a rule being
bent. `.github/CODEOWNERS` requires human review on `.ai/registry/`, `.ai/standards/`, `prisma/`,
`.claude/`, `.github/` and `.mcp.json`. That is what makes recording such a change safe to automate:
the orchestrator records it, a human still approves it. **Recording is not authoring.** RULE-01
governs who *writes* the registry, `guard-registry.mjs` still refuses the orchestrator's `Edit`, and
neither is touched by this exception.

Two limits are not the orchestrator's to weigh:

- **`main` is never a commit or a push target.** `git push origin main` and `git push --force` stay
  denied in settings.
- **Merging stays human.** RULE-09. `gh pr merge` stays denied.

`git push` is deliberately absent from the allow list, so every push prompts once. That prompt is the
last point at which a human sees a branch name before history exists.

### The second exception: a direct instruction

**Any agent may commit and push when the operator instructs it to, in that session, for that work.**
The authorization is the instruction; it does not generalize to the next run, and no agent infers it
from having been given it before.

This is stated rather than left implicit because the alternative is worse in both directions. Unstated,
it makes the first paragraph of this section false the first time an operator says "commit this" to
anything but the orchestrator — and a standard that everyone routinely violates stops being read as a
standard. Stated too broadly, it becomes the exception that swallows the rule. So it is narrow on
purpose: an instruction, in the session, for the work in front of it. Two things it never grants,
because they are not this document's to grant: a merge (RULE-09) and a write to `.ai/registry/**`
(RULE-01, and `guard-registry.mjs` refuses regardless of what anyone was told).

The chore branch prefixes are `ops/` and `fix/`, per **Branches** above. Work that is not a ticket does
not go on `feat/<TICKET-ID>` — that name activates the path guard against a ticket the work has nothing
to do with.

The message references the ticket ID and the stage, whoever writes it:

```
<TICKET-ID>: implement room list read path

Design contract items 1-4. Files listed in 03-impl-log.md.
```

## Pull requests

The loop's terminal output is an **open pull request**, never a merge. Per RULE-09, merges are
permanently human.

`/ship` runs the build, marks the ticket DONE, and opens the PR with `gh pr create`. `gh pr merge` is
in the settings deny list, so an agent that tries to merge is blocked rather than trusted not to.

The PR body links the ticket folder and lists the four gate timestamps.

## Protected operations

Denied in `.claude/settings.json`:

- `git push --force`
- `git push origin main`
- `git reset --hard`
- `gh pr merge`

`git reset --hard` is denied because an agent recovering from a confusing state will reach for it,
and the state it discards includes the artifacts that explain how the confusion happened.

## Branch protection

Points at exactly two status checks: `verify` and `allowed-paths`.

**Do not enable it until `verify.yml` has passed at least once.** A required check that has never
passed blocks every pull request, including the operator's, and the only way out is to disable the
protection you just configured.

## CODEOWNERS

`.github/CODEOWNERS` requires human review on `.ai/registry/`, `.ai/standards/`, `prisma/`,
`.claude/`, `.github/`, and `.mcp.json`. These are the paths where RULE-01 and RULE-09 apply, and
CODEOWNERS is the mechanism that makes them apply to a pull request rather than only to a hook.

## Git is the source of truth

RULE-10. The tracker mirrors state and is never read back to decide what happens next. A ticket's
state is what `ticket.yaml` says on disk, not what a ClickUp status field says.
