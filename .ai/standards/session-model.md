# Session model

How the agents in this system are actually started, how long they live, and how they talk. RULE-11
through RULE-16 state the policy in `.ai/registry/rules.md`; this file states the transport and the
lifecycle that deliver it. Nothing here restates a rule.

## Lifetimes

| Agent | Session | Closes when |
|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | persistent | end of run |
| `ba` | persistent | end of run |
| `tech-lead-design` | persistent | end of run |
| `developer` | ephemeral | ticket DONE or ESCALATED — survives REWORK |
| `tech-lead-review` | ephemeral | after **each** verdict, including a re-review |
| `qa` | ephemeral | after **each** verdict |
| `product` | ephemeral | task done |
| `devops` | ephemeral | task done |

**Roles that get asked stay alive; roles that pass judgement die after speaking.**

The BA and the Tech Lead are the ones asked to explain what they meant, sometimes several tickets
later. A session that still holds the reasoning behind a decision answers that better than one
re-reading its own artifact cold.

A reviewer is the opposite case. A `tech-lead-review` session that remembers working through R4 on
the previous pass will not genuinely work through it again — but the code changed between passes, and
that is the whole reason a second pass exists. Its memory is a liability rather than an asset, so it
dies after each verdict and the next review starts from files. The same argument applies to QA, which
is why neither is on the persistent list.

`developer` sits between the two. It is ephemeral, but it **survives REWORK**, because rework is a
continuation of the same task with new information rather than a new task. Restarting it every cycle
would spend the RULE-06 budget on re-deriving the design instead of on fixing what the reviewer
actually found.

## The orchestrator is the lead session

It is not a subagent. It reads the board, decides what comes next, and **prints the command and the
session it belongs in**. It never invokes a stage owner.

This is what makes the table above enforceable rather than aspirational. A subagent cannot open a
fresh top-level session for a reviewer, and it cannot keep the BA's session alive across tickets — so
a dispatching orchestrator would have to simulate both, and RULE-13 would once again rest on an
agent's good behaviour. A printed instruction that a human runs is a real context boundary. A nested
call is not.

## One ticket, six commands

Each line is run in the session named. `/next-ticket` between stages is optional; the orchestrator
prints the next line after each gate.

| # | Command | Session | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/spec ROO-01` | BA — persistent | `01-story.md` |
| 2 | `/design ROO-01` | Tech Lead — persistent | `02-design.md`, `allowed_paths` in `ticket.yaml` |
| 3 | `/implement ROO-01` | Developer — fresh, kept until DONE or ESCALATED | code, `03-impl-log.md` |
| 4 | `/review ROO-01` | **fresh session, discarded after the verdict** | `04-review.md` |
| 5 | `/qa ROO-01` | **fresh session, discarded after the verdict** | `05-test-plan.md`, `06-test-report.md`, `tests/**` |
| 6 | `/ship ROO-01` | orchestrator — lead | PR opened; a human merges (RULE-09) |

On a FAIL at step 4 or 5, the failure routes per the table in `.ai/01-operating-model.md`. Re-running
`/review` opens **another** fresh session — a re-review never reuses the session that produced the
previous verdict.

## Chat is a file

There is no live message channel. A question is a file write; an answer is an amendment.

- The asking session writes `.ai/board/tickets/<ID>/99-questions.md`. Its front-matter carries
  `to: <agent>` and `asked_at: <ISO8601>`.
- The answering session amends **its own artifact** — the story, the design — appends a `## Changelog`
  line, and writes the answer into `99-questions.md` under the question.
- `.claude/hooks/chat-guard.mjs` inspects writes to `99-questions.md`: it blocks when `to:` names a
  pair the topology forbids before a verdict exists, and it counts entries against `chat_budget`.

The reason to prefer this over a message API is RULE-14. A clarification that reveals an incomplete
upstream artifact must amend that artifact — and with a file transport there is nowhere else for the
answer to live. It cannot be said and forgotten, because saying it is writing it down. A message
channel makes the amendment a second, skippable step; a file makes it the only step.

It also means `consulted` in the artifact front-matter is checkable. `99-questions.md` is the record,
so an artifact claiming no consultation while a question sits in the file is a detectable provenance
failure rather than a matter of trust.

## Phase 2 — Agent Teams

The intended next step is to move SPEC, DESIGN and IN_PROGRESS onto Agent Teams, so the constructing
roles share a live session, while REVIEW and QA stay exactly as they are: fresh, isolated, files
only. The isolation of the judging roles is not negotiable and is not what Phase 2 changes.

It is not adopted yet, and the reasons are worth stating plainly rather than discovering later:

- **Experimental.** The feature is behind a flag and its behaviour may change. Building the loop's
  correctness on it now would mean debugging the harness and the process at the same time.
- **Roughly 7x the tokens.** A live multi-agent session re-sends shared context on every turn. That
  is affordable for a hard design conversation and wasteful for the routine tickets that make up most
  of a board.
- **Team configuration lives outside the repository**, under `~/.claude/`. This is the serious one.
  Everything else governing this system — rules, invariants, permissions, hooks — is in the repo,
  reviewable in a pull request, and covered by CODEOWNERS. A team definition in a home directory is
  none of those things: it cannot be reviewed, it drifts per machine, and a change to it changes how
  agents collaborate with no diff anywhere. Until that configuration can be committed, adopting Agent
  Teams would move a load-bearing part of the process out of version control, which is the opposite
  of what the two-plane model is for.

**Revisit when** team configuration can live in the repository, or when the file transport above is
measured to be the bottleneck. Not before. The current transport is slower per clarification and
fully auditable, and auditability is what is being validated on the first tickets.
