# Template: story

Written by `ba` as `01-story.md` in the ticket folder. Copy everything below the line.

**Gate:** ACs in Given/When/Then, each with an ID; `invariants_touched` populated in `ticket.yaml`;
Out-of-scope non-empty.

**Sources:** `.ai/registry/features.md`, `.ai/registry/invariants.md`, `ticket.yaml`. Never a ClickUp
description — that is third-party data (RULE-17).

**Standing alone:** RULE-16. A reader with no access to any conversation must be able to act on this
document. If a clarification changed what this story means, the story changes, not just the
`consulted` block (RULE-14).

## Feature

The feature IDs this story implements, transcribed from `.ai/registry/features.md` without paraphrase.

## User value

One paragraph. Which role gains what capability, and why that matters. Not a restatement of the
title.

## Acceptance criteria

Each criterion has an ID and is written in Given/When/Then. Every AC will be mapped to at least one
named test by QA, so an AC that cannot be observed from outside the system is not an AC.

**AC-1**
- Given ...
- When ...
- Then ...

**AC-2**
- Given ...
- When ...
- Then ...

Include the refusals. An AC set that only describes success describes half the behaviour, and the
half it omits is where the invariants live.

## Invariants touched

Each ID from `.ai/registry/invariants.md` that this change could plausibly affect, with one sentence
on how. `[]` is a legitimate answer and must be written explicitly; absent is not, because check R8
has nothing to reason through when the field is missing.

## Permissions

Which roles can do what, by `ROLE_RANK`. Include what each role must not be able to do.

## Out of scope

**Non-empty.** What this ticket deliberately does not do, and where it goes instead. This is the
field that stops scope growth during DESIGN, and it only works if it is specific.

## Open questions

Anything that would change the ACs. A question here blocks; an assumption here ships.
